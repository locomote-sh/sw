1. Error when registering service worker:

[locomote] Failed to register service worker TypeError: Cannot read property 'postMessage' of null
    at r (locomote-sw-client.js:1)
    at n.push.t (locomote-sw-client.js:1)
    at r.queued.forEach.e (locomote-sw-client.js:1)
    at Array.forEach (<anonymous>)
    at u.register.then.t (locomote-sw-client.js:1)

Caused by line src/core.js:33 - clients has null items? Need to investigate.

2. Error when reading updates feed (locomote-server):

(node:81902) UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: TypeError: Cannot read property 'date' of undefined
    at jsonlTransformer (/Users/juliangoacher/Work/2018/12/locomote-content-server/lib/filedb/updates.js:92:47)
    at process._tickCallback (internal/process/next_tick.js:68:7)

Caused because record on line 88 has a null/undefined commit property? (Needs to be confirmed).

3. Error when service worker refreshes content:

[locomote] Error doing refresh DOMException: Failed to execute 'put' on 'IDBObjectStore': The transaction has finished.
    at http://localhost:8014/julian/website/locomote-sw-v4.js:1:6509
    at new Promise (<anonymous>)
    at D (http://localhost:8014/julian/website/locomote-sw-v4.js:1:6479)

Caused by line src/idb.js:232 - this error occurred before.


NOTE: Client locomote.refresh() not working *because service worker registration has failed*.
